% Introduction
\section{Introduction}

There is a famous quote by Alfréd
Rényi\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfr\%C3\%A9d_R\%C3\%A9nyi}}
about mathematicians:\\

\textit{``A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.''}\\

\noindent This quote has been widely applied to programmers as well in
the form\\

\textit{``A programmer is a device for turning coffee into code.''}\\

\noindent There has also been active discussion in the
web\footnote{\url{http://giorgiosironi.blogspot.com/2010/03/coffee-and-programming.html}} \footnote{\url{http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/107142/is-there-something-special-about-coffee-and-programming}}
about the coffee drinking habits of programmers. But is there any
scientific validation of this popular myth? The goal of this work is
to take a representative sample of programmers and analyze their
(coffee) drinking habits.

% Research Question
\section{Research Question}
\label{rq}

The objective of this work is to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do programmers drink coffee on daily basis?
\item How much coffee do programmers drink on daily basis?
\end{itemize}

% Methods
\section{Methods}

The research question posed in Chapter \ref{rq} was answered by making
a face-to-face user survey (see Appendix \ref{survey}). The survey was
presented to programmers in the Futurice office.

% Results
\section{Results}

The results presented in Appendix \ref{survey} and visualized in
Appendix \ref{charts} show that approximately 73 \% of the developers
surveyed drink coffee with an average of 3.2 cups a day.

% Discussion
\section{Discussion}

% Problems:
% - What numbers are the results compared to?
% - How big is a cup?
% - What if people drink several different drinks?
% - Is Futurice employees representative of the Software Developer community?
% - Is the surveyed sample representative of Futurice employees?
