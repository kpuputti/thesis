  \noindent \textit{Context  is what makes mobile such  a powerful and
    exiting  medium. It  takes  the foundational  concepts of  western
    civilization  and   evolves  them  to   create  a  new   means  of
    understanding,  or what  ancient Creeks  called  inventio, meaning
    both invention and discovery.}
