% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign).
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers!
% ==================================================================
% Compilation instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
%
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name;
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
%
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------


% Document class for the thesis is report
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can change this but do so at your own risk - it may break other things.
% Note that the option pdftext is used for pdflatex; there is no
% pdflatex option.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,pdftex]{report}

% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is)
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}
% The babel package provides hyphenating instructions for LaTeX. Give
% the languages you wish to use in your thesis as options to the babel
% package (as shown below). You can remove any language you are not
% going to use.
% Examples of valid language codes: english (or USenglish), british,
% finnish, swedish; and so on.
\usepackage[finnish,english]{babel}


% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your
% thesis. It is a very professional font, which will always be
% accepted.
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly).
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.

% Remember, there is no excuse to use Comic Sans, ever, in any
% situation! (Well, maybe in speech bubbles in comics, but there
% are better options for those too)

% Optional packages
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Select those packages that you need for your thesis. You may delete
% or comment the rest.

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations:
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}
% The second example uses author-year citations.
% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below);
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).
% \usepackage[square]{natbib}

% The alltt package provides an all-teletype environment that acts
% like verbatim but you can use LaTeX commands in it. Uncomment if
% you want to use this environment.
% \usepackage{alltt}

% The eurosym package provides a euro symbol. Use with \euro{}
%\usepackage{eurosym}

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renderes
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting).
%\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered
% nicely. See the package documentation for details.
% \usepackage{listings}

% The fancuvrb package provides fancier verbatim environments
% (you can, for example, put borders around the verbatim text area
% and so on). See package for details.
% \usepackage{fancyvrb}

% Supertabular provides a tabular environment that can span multiple
% pages.
%\usepackage{supertabular}
% Longtable provides a tabular environment that can span multiple
% pages. This is used in the example acronyms file.
%\usepackage{longtable}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to set your the page headers
% manually, and allows you to add separator lines and so on.
% Check the package documentation.
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}

% Subfigure package allows you to use subfigures (i.e. many subfigures
% within one figure environment). These can have different labels and
% they are numbered automatically. Check the package documentation.
%\usepackage{subfigure}

% The titlesec package can be used to alter the look of the titles
% of sections, chapters, and so on. This example uses the ``medium''
% package option which sets the titles to a medium size, making them
% a bit smaller than what is the default. You can fine-tune the
% title fonts and sizes by using the package options. See the package
% documentation.
\usepackage[medium]{titlesec}

% The TikZ package allows you to create professional technical figures.
% The learning curve is quite steep, but it is definitely worth it if
% you wish to have really good-looking technical figures.
%\usepackage{tikz}
% You also need to specify which TikZ libraries you use
%\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
%\usetikzlibrary{calc}
%\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
%\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing,decorations.markings}
%\usetikzlibrary{shapes}
%\usetikzlibrary{patterns}


% The aalto-thesis package provides typesetting instructions for the
% standard master's thesis parts (abstracts, front page, and so on)
% Load this package second-to-last, just before the hyperref package.
% Options that you can use:
%   mydraft - renders the thesis in draft mode.
%             Do not use for the final version.
%   doublenumbering - [optional] number the first pages of the thesis
%                     with roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...); and start
%                     arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) only on the
%                     first page of the first chapter
%   twoinstructors  - changes the title of instructors to plural form
%   twosupervisors  - changes the title of supervisors to plural form
%\usepackage[mydraft,twosupervisors]{aalto-thesis}
\usepackage[mydraft]{aalto-thesis}
%\usepackage[mydraft,doublenumbering]{aalto-thesis}

% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.
\RequirePackage[pdftex]{hyperref}
% Setup hyperref so that links are clickable but do not look
% different
\hypersetup{colorlinks=false,raiselinks=false,breaklinks=true}
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}
\hypersetup{bookmarksnumbered=true}
% The following line suggests the PDF reader that it should show the
% first level of bookmarks opened in the hierarchical bookmark view.
\hypersetup{bookmarksopen=true,bookmarksopenlevel=1}
% Hyperref can also set up the PDF metadata fields. These are
% set a bit later on, after the thesis setup.


% Thesis setup
% ==================================================================
% Change these to fit your own thesis.
% \COMMAND always refers to the English version;
% \FCOMMAND refers to the Finnish version; and
% \SCOMMAND refers to the Swedish version.
% You may comment/remove those language variants that you do not use
% (but then you must not include the abstracts for that language)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you do not find the command for a text that is shown in the cover page or
% in the abstract texts, check the aalto-thesis.sty file and locate the text
% from there.
% All the texts are configured in language-specific blocks (lots of commands
% that look like this: \renewcommand{\ATCITY}{Espoo}.
% You can just fix the texts there. Just remember to check all the language
% variants you use (they are all there in the same place).

% Supervisors and instructors
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% If you have two supervisors, write both names here, separate them with a
% double-backslash (see below for an example)
% Also remember to add the package option ``twosupervisors'' or
% ``twoinstructors'' to the aalto-thesis package so that the titles are in
% plural.
% Example of one supervisor:
% Example of twosupervisors:
\newcommand{\SUPERVISOR}{Professor Petri Vuorimaa}
\newcommand{\FSUPERVISOR}{Professori Petri Vuorimaa}

% If you have only one instructor, just write one name here
\newcommand{\INSTRUCTOR}{Risto Sarvas D.Sc.(Tech.)}
\newcommand{\FINSTRUCTOR}{Tohtori Risto Sarvas}

% If you have two supervisors, it is common to write the schools
% of the supervisors in the cover page. If the following command is defined,
% then the supervisor names shown here are printed in the cover page. Otherwise,
% the supervisor names defined above are used.
\newcommand{\COVERSUPERVISOR}{Professor Petri Vuorimaa, Aalto University}

% The same option is for the instructors, if you have multiple instructors.
% \newcommand{\COVERINSTRUCTOR}{Olli Ohjaaja M.Sc. (Tech.), Aalto University\\

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX
% paragraph formatting: paragraphs are indented, and there is no
% space between paragraphs.
% When writing in Finnish, we often use no indentation in the
% beginning of the paragraph, and there is some space between the
% paragraphs.

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if
% you write in English, leave these lines commented!
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins.
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{document}
% This command adds a PDF bookmark to the cover page. You may leave
% it out if you don't like it...
\pdfbookmark[0]{Cover page}{bookmark.0.cover}
% This command is defined in aalto-thesis.sty. It controls the page
% numbering based on whether the doublenumbering option is specified

% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Options: finnish, english, and swedish
% These control in which language the cover-page information is shown

% Table of contents
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\cleardoublepage
% This command adds a PDF bookmark that links to the contents.
% You can use \addcontentsline{} as well, but that also adds contents
