% Lines starting with a percent sign (%) are comments. LaTeX will 
% not process those lines. Similarly, everything after a percent 
% sign in a line is considered a comment. To produce a percent sign
% in the output, write \% (backslash followed by the percent sign). 
% ==================================================================
% Usage instructions:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The file is heavily commented so that you know what the various
% commands do. Feel free to remove any comments you don't need from
% your own copy. When redistributing the example thesis file, please
% retain all the comments for the benefit of other thesis writers! 
% ==================================================================
% Compilation instructions: 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Use pdflatex to compile! Input images are expected as PDF files.
% Example compilation:
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% > pdflatex thesis-example.tex
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You need to run pdflatex multiple times so that all the cross-references
% are fixed. pdflatex will tell you if you need to re-run it (a warning
% will be issued)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Compilation has been tested to work in ukk.cs.hut.fi and kosh.hut.fi
% - if you have problems of missing .sty -files, then the local LaTeX
% environment does not have all the required packages installed.
% For example, when compiling in vipunen.hut.fi, you get an error that
% tikz.sty is missing - in this case you must either compile somewhere
% else, or you cannot use TikZ graphics in your thesis and must therefore
% remove or comment out the tikz package and all the tikz definitions. 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% General information
% ==================================================================
% Package documentation:
% 
% The comments often refer to package documentation. (Almost) all LaTeX
% packages have documentation accompanying them, so you can read the
% package documentation for further information. When a package 'xxx' is
% installed to your local LaTeX environment (the document compiles
% when you have \usepackage{xxx} and LaTeX does not complain), you can 
% find the documentation somewhere in the local LaTeX texmf directory
% hierarchy. In ukk.cs.hut.fi, this is /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist,
% and the documentation for the titlesec package (for example) can be 
% found at /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/titlesec/titlesec.pdf.
% Most often the documentation is located as a PDF file in 
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/xxx, where xxx is the package name; 
% however, documentation for TikZ is in
% /usr/texlive/2008/texmf-dist/doc/latex/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf
% (this is because TikZ is a front-end for PGF, which is meant to be a 
% generic portable graphics format for LaTeX).
% You can try to look for the package manual using the ``find'' shell
% command in Linux machines; the find databases are up-to-date at least
% in ukk.cs.hut.fi. Just type ``find xxx'', where xxx is the package
% name, and you should find a documentation file.
% Note that in some packages, the documentation is in the DVI file
% format. In this case, you can copy the DVI file to your home directory,
% and convert it to PDF with the dvipdfm command (or you can read the
% DVI file directly with a DVI viewer).
% 
% If you can't find the documentation for a package, just try Googling
% for ``latex packagename''; most often you can get a direct link to the
% package manual in PDF format.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------


% Document class for the thesis is report
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can change this but do so at your own risk - it may break other things.
% Note that the option pdftext is used for pdflatex; there is no
% pdflatex option. 
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper,oneside,pdftex]{report}

% The input files (tex files) are encoded with the latin-1 encoding 
% (ISO-8859-1 works). Change the latin1-option if you use UTF8 
% (at some point LaTeX did not work with UTF8, but I'm not sure
% what the current situation is) 
\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}
% OT1 font encoding seems to work better than T1. Check the rendered
% PDF file to see if the fonts are encoded properly as vectors (instead
% of rendered bitmaps). You can do this by zooming very close to any letter 
% - if the letter is shown pixelated, you should change this setting 
% (try commenting out the entire line, for example).  
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}
% The babel package provides hyphenating instructions for LaTeX. Give
% the languages you wish to use in your thesis as options to the babel
% package (as shown below). You can remove any language you are not
% going to use.
% Examples of valid language codes: english (or USenglish), british, 
% finnish, swedish; and so on.
\usepackage[finnish,swedish,english]{babel}


% Font selection
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% The default LaTeX font is a very good font for rendering your 
% thesis. It is a very professional font, which will always be 
% accepted. 
% If you, however, wish to spicen up your thesis, you can try out
% these font variants by uncommenting one of the following lines
% (or by finding another font package). The fonts shown here are 
% all fonts that you could use in your thesis (not too silly). 
% Changing the font causes the layouts to shift a bit; you many
% need to manually adjust some layouts. Check the warning messages
% LaTeX gives you.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% To find another font, check out the font catalogue from
% http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/mathfonts.html
% This link points to the list of fonts that support maths, but
% that's a fairly important point for master's theses.
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% Remember, there is no excuse to use Comic Sans, ever, in any
% situation! (Well, maybe in speech bubbles in comics, but there 
% are better options for those too)

% \usepackage{palatino}
% \usepackage{tgpagella}



% Optional packages
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Select those packages that you need for your thesis. You may delete
% or comment the rest.

% Natbib allows you to select the format of the bibliography references.
% The first example uses numbered citations: 
\usepackage[square,sort&compress,numbers]{natbib}
% The second example uses author-year citations.
% If you use author-year citations, change the bibliography style (below); 
% acm style does not work with author-year citations.
% Also, you should use \citet (cite in text) when you wish to refer
% to the author directly (\citet{blaablaa} said blaa blaa), and 
% \citep when you wish to refer similarly than with numbered citations
% (It has been said that blaa blaa~\citep{blaablaa}).
% \usepackage[square]{natbib}

% The alltt package provides an all-teletype environment that acts
% like verbatim but you can use LaTeX commands in it. Uncomment if 
% you want to use this environment. 
% \usepackage{alltt}

% The eurosym package provides a euro symbol. Use with \euro{}
\usepackage{eurosym} 

% Verbatim provides a standard teletype environment that renderes
% the text exactly as written in the tex file. Useful for code
% snippets (although you can also use the listings package to get
% automatic code formatting). 
\usepackage{verbatim}

% The listing package provides automatic code formatting utilities
% so that you can copy-paste code examples and have them rendered
% nicely. See the package documentation for details.
% \usepackage{listings}

% The fancuvrb package provides fancier verbatim environments 
% (you can, for example, put borders around the verbatim text area
% and so on). See package for details.
% \usepackage{fancyvrb}

% Supertabular provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. 
%\usepackage{supertabular}
% Longtable provides a tabular environment that can span multiple 
% pages. This is used in the example acronyms file. 
\usepackage{longtable}

% The fancyhdr package allows you to set your the page headers 
% manually, and allows you to add separator lines and so on. 
% Check the package documentation. 
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}

% Subfigure package allows you to use subfigures (i.e. many subfigures
% within one figure environment). These can have different labels and
% they are numbered automatically. Check the package documentation. 
\usepackage{subfigure}

% The titlesec package can be used to alter the look of the titles 
% of sections, chapters, and so on. This example uses the ``medium'' 
% package option which sets the titles to a medium size, making them
% a bit smaller than what is the default. You can fine-tune the 
% title fonts and sizes by using the package options. See the package
% documentation.
\usepackage[medium]{titlesec}

% The TikZ package allows you to create professional technical figures.
% The learning curve is quite steep, but it is definitely worth it if 
% you wish to have really good-looking technical figures. 
\usepackage{tikz}
% You also need to specify which TikZ libraries you use
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\usetikzlibrary{decorations.pathmorphing,decorations.markings}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes}
\usetikzlibrary{patterns}


% The aalto-thesis package provides typesetting instructions for the
% standard master's thesis parts (abstracts, front page, and so on)
% Load this package second-to-last, just before the hyperref package.
% Options that you can use: 
%   mydraft - renders the thesis in draft mode. 
%             Do not use for the final version. 
%   doublenumbering - [optional] number the first pages of the thesis
%                     with roman numerals (i, ii, iii, ...); and start
%                     arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, ...) only on the 
%                     first page of the first chapter

% Hyperref
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% Hyperref creates links from URLs, for references, and creates a
% TOC in the PDF file.
% This package must be the last one you include, because it has
% compatibility issues with many other packages and it fixes
% those issues when it is loaded.

% Layout settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------

% When you write in English, you should use the standard LaTeX

% space between paragraphs.
% When writing in Finnish, we often use no indentation in the
% beginning of the paragraph, and there is some space between the 
% paragraphs. 

% If you write your thesis Finnish, uncomment these lines; if 
% you write in English, leave these lines commented! 
% \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
% \setlength{\parskip}{1ex}

% Use this to control how much space there is between each line of text.
% 1 is normal (no extra space), 1.3 is about one-half more space, and
% 1.6 is about double line spacing.  
% \linespread{1} % This is the default
% \linespread{1.3}

% Bibliography style
% acm style gives you a basic reference style. It works only with numbered
% references.
\bibliographystyle{acm}
% Plainnat is a plain style that works with both numbered and name citations.
% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}


% Extra hyphenation settings
% ------------------------------------------------------------------
% You can list here all the files that are not hyphenated correctly.
% You can provide many \hyphenation commands and/or separate each word
% with a space inside a single command. Put hyphens in the places where
% a word can be hyphenated.
% Note that (by default) LaTeX will not hyphenate words that already
% have a hyphen in them (for example, if you write ``structure-modification 
% operation'', the word structure-modification will never be hyphenated).
% You need a special package to hyphenate those words.
\hyphenation{di-gi-taa-li-sta yksi-suun-tai-sta}



% The preamble ends here, and the document begins. 
% Place all formatting commands and such before this line.

\thesisabstract{english}{
A dissertation or thesis is a document submitted in support of candidature
for a degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and
findings. In some countries/universities, the word thesis or a cognate is used
as part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally
applied to a doctorate, whilst, in others, the reverse is true.

\fixme{Abstract text goes here (and this is an example how to use fixme).} 
Fixme is a command that helps you identify parts of your thesis that still
require some work. When compiled in the custom \texttt{mydraft} mode, text
parts tagged with fixmes are shown in bold and with fixme tags around them. When
compiled in normal mode, the fixme-tagged text is shown normally (without
special formatting). The draft mode also causes the ``Draft'' text to appear on
the front page, alongside with the document compilation date. The custom
\texttt{mydraft} mode is selected by the \texttt{mydraft} option given for the
package \texttt{aalto-thesis}, near the top of the \texttt{thesis-example.tex}
file.

The thesis example file (\texttt{thesis-example.tex}), all the chapter content
files (\texttt{1introduction.tex} and so on), and the Aalto style file
(\texttt{aalto-thesis.sty}) are commented with explanations on how the Aalto
thesis works. The files also contain some examples on how to customize various
details of the thesis layout, and of course the example text works as an
example in itself. Please read the comments and the example text; that should
get you well on your way!}

Kivi on materiaali, joka muodostuu mineraaleista ja luokitellaan
mineraalisisältönsä mukaan. Kivet luokitellaan yleensä ne muodostaneiden
prosessien mukaan magmakiviin, sedimenttikiviin ja metamorfisiin kiviin.
Magmakivet ovat muodostuneet kiteytyneestä magmasta, sedimenttikivet vanhempien
kivilajien rapautuessa ja muodostaessa iskostuneita yhdisteitä, metamorfiset
kivet taas kun magma- ja sedimenttikivet joutuvat syvällä maan kuoressa
lämpötilan ja kovan paineen alaiseksi.

Kivi on epäorgaaninen eli elottoman luonnon aine, mikä tarkoittaa ettei se
sisällä hiiltä tai muita elollisen orgaanisen luonnon aineita. Niinpä kivestä
tehdyt esineet säilyvät maaperässä tuhansien vuosien ajan mätänemättä. Kun

Lilla Vargens universum är det tredje fiktiva universumet inom huvudfåran av de
tecknade disneyserierna - de övriga två är Kalle Ankas och Musse Piggs
universum. Figurerna runt Lilla Vargen kommer huvudsakligen från tre källor ---
dels persongalleriet i kortfilmen Tre små grisar från 1933 och dess uppföljare,
dels långfilmen Sången om Södern från 1946, och dels från episoden ``Bongo'' i
långfilmen Pank och fågelfri från 1947. Framför allt de två första har
sedermera även kommit att leva vidare, utvidgas och införlivas i varandra genom
tecknade serier, främst sådana producerade av Western Publishing för
amerikanska Disneytidningar under åren 1945--1984. 

Världen runt Lilla Vargen är, i jämförelse med den runt Kalle Anka eller Musse
Pigg, inte helt enhetlig, vilket bland annat märks i Bror Björns skiftande
personlighet. Den har även varit betydligt mer öppen för influenser från andra
Disneyvärldar, inte minst de tecknade långfilmerna. Ytterligare en skillnad är
att varelserna i vargserierna förefaller stå närmare sina förebilder inom den
verkliga djurvärlden. Att vargen Zeke vill äta upp grisen Bror Duktig är till
exempel ett ständigt återkommande tema, men om katten Svarte Petter skulle få
för sig att äta upp musen Musse Pigg skulle detta antagligen höja ett och annat
ögonbryn bland läsarna.}
